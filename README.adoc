= Hamster Handbook

A newbie guide to amateur radio.

== Installation

I use a mac.
Adjust accordingly.
At bottom of the stack is AsciiDoc, a delightful markup language.
While there are many ways to use AsciiDoc, I prefer a WYSIWYG style when I can get it, and IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition has the plug-ins to make this fully functional (for free!).

.  brew install intellij-idea-ce
. install AsciiDoc plug-in in IntelliJ
. git clone git@github.com:timborn/hamster-handbook.git
