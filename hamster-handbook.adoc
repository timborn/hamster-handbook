== Overview

Notes made by a ham newbie as he muddled his way through the learning curve.

= Scenarios

. just chatting ("rag chew")
. automatic position reporting (see APRS)
. operating remotely - QRM, solar powered
. operating remotely - canyons and other obstacles
. disaster assistance - reconnecting to a net, operating in a net, operating the net

= Morse Code

For completeness, Morse code (CW) is included.
It requires you to learn Morse, however.
From many perspectives, CW is optimal - low bandwidth, low power, it can get through whenm voice cannot, and the kit to start operating is probably the least expensive -- assuming you can get past the 'learn Morse' part.

Morse code used to be called Continuous Wave (CW).

= Voice

AM, FM, side band

= Digital Modes

It appears that digital is where a lot of the experimentation is happening.
While CW & voice are well understood and pretty stable, digital provides a ton of opportunities to play with protocols, error checking & correction, TDMA, data+voice and a ton of other things.

I'm attracted to digital modes because it appears it may be possible to get a message through with a low power transmitter when voice wouldn't cut it.

== ALE - Automatic Link Establishment

Problem: after a disaster how to hams reconnect with each other?

Solution: ALE is a set of fixed frequencies and a protocol for scanning those frequencies to find and reconnect hams to each other.

== APRS -

digipeater, iGate, microsat, aprsdroid

https://aprs.fi

== JS8CALL

???

== RTTY

**R**adio **T**ele**TY**pe - pretty vintage stuff, but still being used, apparently.

Tutorial for beginners and MMTTY software (MSWin only, alas) available at https://hamsoft.ca/pages/mmtty.php

. AFSK - ?

"LSB is the convention for AFSK"

= Antennas

If you want to analyze an antenna design, AFAIK the only free software left for this is https://www.qsl.net/4nec2/
It has a very steep learning curve, but it could be useful.
(extra credit: is the fractal antenna in White Collar really an antenna?  What properties do you get from the fractal shape?)

MMANA-GAL appears to be free antenna analysis software.
MSWin only, sadly.

= Coolest Website Ever

Imagine being able to operate a ham radio (receive only) from your browser.
Practice dialing in signals and understanding the bands.
Thanks to Software Defined Radio [SDR] and some generous people, you can!

There is a list of other operating locations here:
http://websdr.org/

SDR is pretty magical, in that dozens of people can operate simultaneously.

= Projects

== Project #1 - APRS on the Cheap

Minimal materials to get experience with APRS.
Proposed solution: APRSdriod running on cell phone, connected to a dual band Handy Talkie (HT).

SITE for APRSdroid and where you can download it free

Phyical wiring and cable construction

operating APRSdroid - what can you do with it?

== Q-Codes

Q-signals are a system of radio shorthand as old as wireless and developed from even older telegraphy codes. Q-signals are a set of abbreviations for common information that save time and allow communication between operators who don’t speak a common language. Modern ham radio uses them extensively. The table below lists the most common Q-signals used by hams. While Q-signals were developed for use by Morse operators, their use is common on phone, as well. You will often hear, “QRZed?” as someone asks “Who is calling me?” or “I’m getting a little QRM” from an operator receiving some interference or “Let’s QSY to 146.55” as two operators change from a repeater frequency to a nearby simplex communications frequency.

|===
|QRG |Your exact frequency (or that of ______) is _________kHz. Will you tell me my exact frequency (or that of __________)?
|QRL |I am busy (or I am busy with _________). Are you busy? Usually used to see if a frequency is busy.
|QRM |Your transmission is being interfered with _________ (1. Nil; 2. Slightly; 3. Moderately; 4. Severely; 5. Extremely.) Is my transmission being interfered with?
|QRN |I am troubled by static _________. (1 to 5 as under QRM.) Are you troubled by static?
|QRO |Increase power. Shall I increase power?
|QRP |Decrease power. Shall I decrease power?
|QRQ |Send faster (_________wpm). Shall I send faster?
|QRS |Send more slowly (_________wpm). Shall I send more slowly?
|QRT |Stop sending. Shall I stop sending?
|QRU |I have nothing for you. Have you anything for me?
|QRV |I am ready. Are you ready?
|QRX |I will call you again at ______hours (on ______kHz).  When will you call me again? Minutes are usually implied rather than hours.
|QRZ |You are being called by _________ (on ______kHz). Who is calling me?
|QSB |Your signals are fading. Are my signals fading?
|QSK |I can hear you between signals; break in on my transmission.  Can you hear me between your signals and if so can I break in on your transmission?
|QSL |I am acknowledging receipt.  Can you acknowledge receipt (of a message or transmission)?
|QSO |I can communicate with _________ direct (or relay through ______). Can you communicate with ______ direct or by relay?
|QSP |I will relay to ______. Will you relay to ______?
|QST |General call preceding a message addressed to all amateurs and ARRL members. This is in effect “CQ ARRL.”
|QSX |I am listening to ______ on ______kHz. Will you listen to ______on ______kHz?
|QSY |Change to transmission on another frequency (or on ______kHz).  Shall I change to transmission on another frequency (or on ______kHz)?
|QTC |I have ______messages for you (or for ______).  How many messages have you to send?
|QTH |My location is _________. What is your location?
|QTR |The time is _________. What is the correct time?
